        <label for="faq-1" class="question">How do I purchase tickets?</label>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Purchasing tickets through our website
                is a simple and secure process. First,
                browse our list of upcoming concerts and
                select the one you’re interested in. Once
                you’ve found it, click on the ‘Buy Tickets’ button.
                This will take you to a page where you can view a
                seating chart of the venue. Here, you can select
                the seats you prefer based on availability and price.
                After selecting your seats, you’ll be prompted to
                enter your payment information. We accept various payment
                methods, including credit/debit cards and PayPal. Once
                your transaction is complete, you’ll receive a confirmation
                email with your ticket details. Remember to check your
                email’s spam folder if you don't see the confirmation
                in your inbox.</p>

        <input type="checkbox" id="faq-2" hidden/>
        <label for="faq-2" class="question">Can I get a refund if I can no longer attend the concert?</label>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>We understand that plans can change, but as per our policy,
                ticket sales are non-refundable. This is standard practice
                in the industry, as it allows us to ensure a stable and fair
                ticketing process for all customers. However, we do offer the
                option to transfer your ticket to someone else. If you find
                yourself unable to attend, you can change the name on the ticket
                for someone else to use. This process can be done by contacting
                our customer support team and providing them with the details of
                the new attendee. Please note that any such transfer should be
                completed at least 24 hours before the event.</p>

        <label for="faq-3" class="question">What should I do if I haven’t received my tickets?</label>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>If you haven’t received your tickets via email within
                24 hours of your purchase, there are a few steps you
                can take. First, ensure that the email address you
                provided during the purchase process is correct.
                Next, check your spam or junk email folder, as sometimes
                emails from new addresses can be filtered there. If you
                still can’t find your tickets, please contact our
                customer service team with your order number and
                the name and email address used to purchase the
                tickets. Our team will investigate and re-send your
                tickets promptly. Your tickets are important, and
                we are committed to ensuring you receive them
                well in advance of the concert. </p>

        <input type="checkbox" id="faq-4" hidden/>
        <label for="faq-4" class="question">Are there any discounts available for group bookings?</label>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>We’re thrilled to accommodate groups looking to enjoy
                a concert together! For groups of 10 or more, we offer
                special discount rates. This is a great option for
                corporate events, school trips, clubs, or even a large
                gathering of friends and family. To take advantage of
                this offer, please contact our group sales department.
                They will assist you with selecting seats, processing
                the payment, and providing all necessary information.
                Depending on the event, additional perks may be available
                for large groups, such as reserved seating or early entry.
                Please inquire with our group sales team for more details.</p>

        <label for="faq-5" class="question">What happens if the concert is canceled or postponed?</label>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>In the rare event that a concert is canceled or
                postponed, we prioritize communicating with all
                ticket holders immediately. If a concert is canceled,
                you are entitled to a full refund, including any
                service fees. The refund process is automatic and
                will be issued to the same method of payment used
                to make the purchase. Please allow a few business
                days for the transaction to process. If the concert
                is postponed, your ticket will remain valid for the
                rescheduled date. We will provide you with all the
                new details as soon as they are confirmed. If you
                cannot attend the rescheduled date, you will have
                the option to request a refund.</p>

        <input type="checkbox" id="faq-6" hidden/>
        <label for="faq-6" class="question">Can I choose my seats when booking tickets?</label>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Absolutely! We believe in providing you with the flexibility
                to choose your own seating at the concert. Our online booking
                system includes an interactive seating chart of the venue,
                allowing you to see the layout and select your preferred
                seats. You can choose based on proximity to the stage, view
                angles, and price categories. The earlier you book, the more
                options you’ll have as popular events can sell out quickly.
                We recommend booking as soon as possible to get the best seats.
                If you have any special seating requirements, such as wheelchair
                accessibility or other accommodations, please contact our
                customer service team for personalized assistance.</p>
